### CUniPlot

CUniPlot (pronounced "see-you-nee-plot") is short for C Unicode Plotter. It's a pretty dinky command line plotting tool I wrote in C. Currently, it only supports the creation of line graphs and histograms, but I hope to expand the library over time. Much of the plot's formatting can be specified via command line arguments, but that being said, there are still a fair amount of features that need to be implemented.
